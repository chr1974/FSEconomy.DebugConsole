# FSEconomy.DebugConsole

A Console Application i Made to write code to read from the FSEconomy DataFeed and FSEconomy API Endpoints

For now i have only added datafeed for retrieving All Aricraft Configs, And All Aircrafts that are for sale.

Im using a servicekey so i can have more request more often, if you are using only readaccesskey, you must edit the BuildAircraftDataUrl function, so the url will be built correctly based of readaccess key. you fint the format on datafeed page in FSEconomy Game Interface. To use service key, you need to obtain one from FSEconomy staff.

the idea around this project is to make it into a library for other to use to retrieve data and amutomate sertain tasks in fseconomy. There are many possibilities from buying, selling, leasing aircrafts, group maintenance, transfer/deposit/withdraw cash from owner or owner groups etc.

it is only in its early stages. any contribution are welcome. later i will also start building userinterface for the library to.
